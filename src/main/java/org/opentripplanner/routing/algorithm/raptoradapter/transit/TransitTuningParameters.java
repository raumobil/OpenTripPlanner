   * search-window to around 2 hours during the day ({@code numItineraries=20}) and up to 8h during

   * <p>
   * The provided array of durations is used to increase the search-window for the next/previous
   * page when the current page return few options. If ZERO results is returned the first duration
   * in the list is used, if ONE result is returned then the second duration is used and so on. The
   * duration is added to the existing search-window and inserted into the next and previous page
   * cursor.
   * <p>
   * This parameter controls how the search-window is increased. OTP also reduces the
   * search-window when more than the requested itineraries are fetched. This is done
   * automatically and acn not be configured. Do not be afraid of scaling up fast, it will be
   * reduced to the appropriate level in the next search.
   * <p>
   * The extra time is added to the search-window for the next request if the current result have
   * few itineraries.
